# WEEK 1 JS PRACTICE
All the programs can be tested when you go to the Chrome developer tools console after launching the html file.

To test the program, input the function and the arguments, 
eg: For the salary. js, in the chrome developer tools console, type: calculateNetSalary(78000, 15000).
The expected output will be 60382.5. This is the output which you will see

The same applies for the speed.js file and the student.js file.
